    <p>Wikitongues accepts videos from people all over the world. In order to provide content that is consistent, please read below for a description of what we look for.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Subject</h4>
            <p>You. Talk about yourself — your language, country, or culture; your family, passions or home. Be yourself! Speak formally or informally, in the accent you’re most comfortable. Be comfortable! Keep in mind that first and foremost, you’re speaking for yourself.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Style</h4>
            <p>Look directly at the camera while you speak and frame your portrait intimately, from the shoulders up, or closer. Viewers should feel like you’re talking to them directly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Format</h4>
            <p>Wikitongues accepts videos of any level of technical quality. If you have access to a webcam or a smartphone, great! If you have access to professional audiovisual equipment, even better. For comparative production quality guidelines, see the table below.</p>
